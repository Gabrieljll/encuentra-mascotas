Social network type website in order to upload images regarding lost pets.
==================

Project functionality
------------------------

The main functionality of this project is to be able to make people who lose their pets have extra help to find them. This application is aimed at those people who find these pets and want to collaborate so that the pet and the owner meet again. Owners searching for their pets will access the app to try to find their pets, while other people will use the app to post the pet they found.

Â¿How to use the application?
-----------------------------
It is only necessary to register with an email and password, and then access with these data. Once inside, you will be able to view a list of pet images that have been found by people who are looking for the owner of said pet (This in case there are previously people who added these pets).

At the top a navigation bar is displayed which you can use in case you have found a pet and want to collaborate. To do so, you just need to click on the "Add pet" button. After this you will only need to fill out a form with a photo and all the information you can provide about the animal. Finally press "Done" and you will return to the initial menu where you can see your recent publication.
